Tweet wisdom to world leaders.

## Who was Marcus Aurelius?

He was last of the 5 good emperors of the Roman Empire (reign 161-180AD). He also had a lifelong interest in philosophy. 

Marcus read in the school of the Stoics, an austere philosophy usually summarized by the maxim

---
` virtue is the only good`
---

Marcus wrote his thoughts for his own use, known today as the *Meditations*. This text is not only a valuable source of Stoic philosophy in the 2nd century AD but a headspring of wisdom.

Listen to Marcus, listen to his thoughts, and follow on twitter.
